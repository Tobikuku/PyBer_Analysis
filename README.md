Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze the city and ride data (rideshare data) using matplotlib and pandas to calculate and create visualization for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. This project is to be completed by merging the data and by creating a dataframe that includes the average fare per driver for each city type, total driver per city and the average fare per ride and driver and using the line graph to help the CEO visualize the data.
 

Results

The total rides for the rural city type is 125, 625 for the Suburban city and 1625 for the urban city type. This has the least rides out of all the city types. However, the average fare per ride is highest at $34.623 as opposed to the $30.97 fare per ride for the Suburban city type and $24.52 for the Urban city type. The average fare per driver is also highest in the rural city at $55.48 and $39.50 for the suburban city and $16.57 for the urban city.

Summary

The city type(rural) with the highest amount of fare have the least amount of cars and drivers. This suggests that the more cars and drivers, the lower fares per ride and driver is. 

Recommendation

•	Increase the driver count in the rural city so that the total rides will increase.
•	Reduce the fare. This might stabilize and reduce fares due to competition.
•	To improve the rates the drivers in the city get and try to alleviate disparities, in the rates that urban drivers get as compared to the rates the rural drivers get
